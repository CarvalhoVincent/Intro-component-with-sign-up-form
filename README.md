## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript



### What I learned

I learned how to use some new pseudo-class and pseudo-elements for the first time.
Also improved my Grid skills, and learned how a Form works with the submit button.
And how to display a personalized error message if the fields are not valid with JS.



### Continued development

I need to practice more with JavaScript, cause I understand how it works but I still need some help to build correctly what I want.



### Useful resources


- [https://www.w3schools.com] - Use it for some searches and reminders.
- [https://stackoverflow.com/ ] - Use for some information about the Email pattern syntax.
- [https://code-boxx.com/show-error-messages-html-forms/] - Use it for the form validity.

## Acknowledgments

I found a solution for the JS to check validity of the Form, I had the same idea but still not able to do it without some help. I edited some parts of this to optimize it for my project.
